## Ensure templates are updated for scan.

I couldn't get this to work via code :-( I tried changing the directory but it still wanted to 
search under the home directory and nuclei-templates


So execute this 
```bash
  sudo nuclei -ut
```


# Execute program using

```bash
 sudo go run main.go
```


This will produce the following error, its worth noting that naabu is never executed.. but the panic is from naabu

Here is the panic

```bash
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x2 addr=0x0 pc=0x1007c2db4]

goroutine 53 [running]:

```

and here are the logs that my app produces
